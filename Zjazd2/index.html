                    The 2009 World Series was the championship series of Major League Baseball's 2009 season. Opening on October 28, it was a best-of-seven playoff between the Philadelphia Phillies, champions of the National League and defending World Series champions, and the New York Yankees, champions of the American League. The Yankees defeated the Phillies, 4 games to 2, with a Game 6 victory in which Hideki Matsui hit his third home run of the series. He was named Most Valuable Player of the series, making him the first Japanese-born player to win the award. 	
                    After the Bath, Woman Drying Herself is a pastel drawing by Edgar Degas, made at some point between 1890 and 1895. The work is part of a series of drawings, preliminary sketches and completed works in pastels and oils by Degas from this period that depict women bathing. The drawing was made on several pieces of paper mounted on cardboard. Degas may have started with a smaller composition which he extended as he worked, requiring more paper. The work had a considerable influence on Francis Bacon, most noticeably on his triptychs Three Figures in a Room (1964) and Three Studies of the Male Back (1970). The painting is now in the National Gallery in London.
